Some things about learn.

print("Hello world!")

You know ,we ofen wtriter "Hello World" in our first code when we learn a new language.
It's so easy that there is only one raw code,because this's swift.

I have learned swift at about Noemver 2015. I like ios so that i would like to do ios development.
I think everyone should flow himself's heart, do what he want to do!
